At the moment the bot cant do much but heres what it can do.

- Roll random dice with slash commands 
- Flip a coin using slash commands
- Reply Hello to anyone saying hello
- Read a data.json file stored locally
- Ping/Pong reply

If anyone stumbles on this repo please let me know how I should optimize it/ what functionalities I should add to it.
